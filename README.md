Hello everyone , here i have used an unsupervised technique which is popular and as well effective learning called K MEANs
The steps that are followed in machine learning are 
Imported the data with the help of python libraries 
Then read the data performed qucik Exploratory Data Analysis to it 
Then came up to the scaling part of the data i.e data pre processing in order make the cluster points for kmeans 
After this i have applied Kmeans to the data set which we have selected as a target variables
Then found out the centroids of the clusters 
Plotted the scatter plot where points are differntiated with the help of plotting and clusters were defined perfectly 
If you have any queiries regarding this clusttering do contact me !!
